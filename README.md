## Data exploration and crude time series experiments with pharmaceuticals sales data

Contains a collection of experiments for understanding sales data from a large multinational pharmaceuticals and life sciences company. The data itself is hierarchical univariate time series data, segmented into markets, laboratories, brands, down to SKU level, with unit sales and turnover reported monthly for the period July 2014 to July 2017. Unfortunately, even if I was permitted to upload the data and make it publicly available, I'm unable to because the filesize is over 10 GB.
